This application uses Nettoshpere (https://github.com/Atmosphere/nettosphere) and Atmosphere (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) framework to create a simple 'server to client' websocket based streaming application. The server periodically broadcasts current time to all the connected clients.
The server also echoes back any message the client sends to it.

Running the application

If you are using Eclipse:
1. Start server - Launch MyNettosphereServer
2a. Start client - Launch TestNettosphereClient
2b. For testing on a browser, open index.html in a browser that supports WebSocket e.g. Chrome and click on "Connect".

If you are using Maven:
1. mvn clean install
2. Start server - java -jar target\NettosphereSample-1.0.jar
3a. Start client - Launch TestNettosphereClient
