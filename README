This application uses Nettoshpere (https://github.com/Atmosphere/nettosphere) and
Atmosphere (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) framework to create a simple 'server to client' websocket
based streaming application. The server periodically broadcasts current time to all the connected clients.
The server also echoes back any message the client sends to it.

Running the application
-----------------------

Assuming the code has been compiled.
1. Start server - Launch MyNettosphereServer
2a. Start client - Launch TestNettosphereClient
2b. For testing on a browser, open index.html in browser that support WebSocket e.g. Chrome and click on "Connect".
